# Group IV Project: Soil Suitability Checker and Crop Recommender System

## Overview
This project aims to assist in agricultural decision-making by providing tools to analyze soil data and recommend suitable crops. It combines data modeling and web development to create an interactive platform for users to input soil parameters and receive actionable insights.

### Key Features:
1. **Soil Suitability Checker and Crop Recommender System**: A recommendation system that suggests suitable crops based on soil pH, nutrient levels, and other parameters.
2. **Soil Data Visualizer**: A tool to input soil parameters (e.g., pH, moisture, NPK levels) and generate visual analyses such as bar charts or pie charts.

## Setup Instructions
1. Ensure that you have Node.js installed. You can verify the installation by running:
    ```bash
    node -v
    ```
2. Initialize your project by creating a package.json file with default settings:
    ```bash
    npm init -y
    ```
    This will generate a basic package.json file at the root of your project.
3. Install required dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install express chart.js body-parser
    ```
4. Create your main application file (e.g., `index.js`) or adjust the entry point in `package.json` as needed.
5. To run the project, execute:
    ```bash
    node index.js
    ```

## Project Structure
- **Data Modeling**: Machine learning models to predict crop suitability based on soil data.
- **Website**: A user-friendly interface for data input, visualization, and interaction with the model.


## Additional Notes
- Customize the `package.json` file to include scripts, dependencies, or other configurations specific to your project's requirements.
- For further development, consider adding linting, testing, and build scripts to streamline your workflow.
